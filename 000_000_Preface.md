# Preface

Perl is a very fast moving language, at least, it is in regards to its
usage.

This can be hard to notice, especially for anyone who only tracks perl releases,
     or only reads published literature, for many reasons.

But the net effect, is there is a bulk of people in the world, remote from the Perl community,
    who have only learnt Perl as it was at the turn of the last decade,
    learnt Perl from material that is now woefully outdated,
    or learnt Perl by example from reading poor qualtiy code they found lying around the internet.

If you're under the impression that because Perl's first number hasn't gone up one in the last 10 years,
   that it indicates that the language, and the culture built around it, also hasn't changed,
   you're in for a surprise.

If your last experience with Perl, or perl literature, was even as short as 5 years ago,
   there's still a lot you may have missed out on.

In essence, this book is a refreshing primer on Whats New in Perl,
   and aims to provide compelling new reasons to use Perl if you had decided previously it was not for you,
   and aims to provide compelling new reasons to uses a **recent** version of Perl for those who are still working on Perl stacks versions 5.014 or older.

Alternative titles for this book could have been "Perl 5.020 for Perl 5.006 coders", or something along those lines, and this book aims to document:
  * new features in Perl itself that are worth using
  * recent innovations in CPAN modules and CPAN workflows
